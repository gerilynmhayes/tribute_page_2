		<p><em>"Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica."</em> -Jim "Tuna" Halpert</p>
		<p>What do you mean you don't recognize this quote? Stream the "Product Recall" cold open of 'The Office' right now! (That's season 3, episode 20.)</p>
		<p>For those of us who've watched this American television series at least 50 times, we can immediately recall Jim Halpert's mockery of Dwight Schrute, a loveable oddball character played by actor Rainn Wilson. In one moment, Jim accurately sums up everything you'll ever need to know about Dwight Schrute's values. The cold opening is a brilliant display of acting talent as Krasinki's Jim bests Dwight with one of the most spot-on imitations of television's most unlikely hero.</p>
		<p>TV viewers have learned that Wilson's Dwight is much more complex than Jim's summation. But what do we know about the man behind the camera?</p>
