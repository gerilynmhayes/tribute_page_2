		<p><i>What do you mean you don't recognize this quote?</i>

		<p>Stream the "Product Recall" cold open of 'The Office' right now! (<a href="https://youtu.be/WaaANll8h18" target="_blank">That's season 3, episode 20.</a>)</p>

		<p>For those of us who've watched this American television series at least 50 times, we can immediately recall Jim Halpert's mockery of Dwight Schruteâ€“the contemptable/loveable oddball character played by actor Rainn Wilson.</p>

		<p>In one moment, Jim sums up everything you'll ever need to know about Dwight Schrute's values. The cold opening is a brilliant display of acting talent as Krasinki's Jim bests Wilson's Dwight with one of the most spot-on imitations of television's most unlikely hero.</p>
		
		<p>TV viewers have learned that Dwight K. "Danger" Schrute is much more complex than Jim's summation. But what do we know about the man behind the banana cream button downs and signature glasses?</p>
		
			<h3>7 Things You Didn't Know About Rainn Wilson</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Rainn Wilson is a practitioner of the <a href="https://www.bahai.us/beliefs/" target="_blank">Baha'i Faith</a>. When you visit <a href="https://www.bahai.us/beliefs/" target="_blank">bahai.us</a>, you'll find several core beliefs of the Baha'i who believe that everyone on Earth is apart of "one human family." Wilson talks about this belief system in the footnote of his memoir titled <u id="book">The Bassoon King: Art, Idiocy, and Other Sordid Tales from the Band Room</u>.</li>
					
					<li>Wilson spent several of his childhood years in Nicaragua. In his memoir, Wilson illustrates a vibrant yet sometimes dangerous rearing in the Central American country. One memorable recount includes a mosquito net and a bout of diarhe---- Well, you get the point: <em>He's survived some things</em>.</li>
					
					<li>Wilson is married to a woman who wrote a book about cats. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday_Reinhorn">Holiday Reinhorn</a> is an American fiction writer who just so happened to nestle her lovely self into the heart of one Rainn Wilson. The writer is known for her published works <u id="book">Big Cats</u> (Free Press, 2005) and pieces in Gulf Coast and Ploughshares. According to Wilson, Reinhorn is the bee's knees. After all, her incredible humanitarian work is irrefutable.</li>

					<li>Holy crap! Rainn Wilson is PUNK ROCKER. Well, a post-punker to be specific. Believe me... I had a fantastic freakout when Wilson described his affinity for X. Don't know what I'm talking about? <a href="https://www.xtheband.com/discography">Listen now.</a> (Come back to this site when you're done, k? Thanx!)</li>

					<li>Galaxy Quest wouldn't be same without him! Wilson played an alien named Lahnk. Although the role was small, you can never unsee Wilson's on-screen genius. In an interview for <a href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/rainn-wilson-would-love-to-revisit-galaxy-quest-just-not-in-the-role-of-supporting-alien">SYFYWire</a>, Wilson told Adam Pockross, I think it's a classic film that people will be watching for hundreds or thousands of years, if we're still around on the planet, and I'm so happy that I got to be in it."</li>

					<li>Apparently this dude was weird looking baby. Hey! He said it, not me. When you read his memoir, Wilson paints a searingly awkward picture of his infant self. Belly shaking laughter will ensue. I highly recommend you get the book if you don't have a copy already.</li>

					<li>Wilson is very active on social media. All fans of Rainn Wilson can benefit from the actor's passionate social awareness and activism-based social media posts. Wilson offers insights into issues that impact humans of ever race, creed, and culture. He and his wife are avid volunteers and encourage others to participate in humanitarian causes.</li>
